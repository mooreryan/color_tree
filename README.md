Color branches and edit stuff. Outputs a nexus file for use in
FigTree.

Occasionally FigTree will color things when you haven't specifically
asked it to do so. This is likely due to you having colored branches
or taxa names with similar rules in the same session. Regardless,
restart FigTree and try again.

## Set up ##

Clone the repo to your favorite local folder.

	git clone https://github.com/mooreryan/color_tree.git

Copy the `color_tree` script to somewhere you enjoy putting
executable files. May I suggest `~/bin` ?

	cp color_tree/color_tree ~/bin

Assuming `~/bin` is on your path, you're ready to go!

## Synopsis ##

	color_tree [-bth] [-r min_bootstrap] [-p pattern_file] [-n name_map] newick_file

## Options ##

    Options:
      -b, --color-branches                 Color branches?
      -t, --color-taxa-names               Color label names?
      -r, --remove-bootstraps-below=<f>    Remove bootstrap values below given value
      -p, --patterns=<s>                   Pattern file name
      -n, --name-map=<s>                   File with name mappings
      -h, --help                           Show this message

## Examples ##

Remove all bootstrap values below 0.5:

	color_tree -r 0.5 tree.newick

Color branches according to patterns in patterns.txt:

	color_tree -b tree.newick patterns.txt

Color branches and taxa names:

	color_tree -bt tree.newick patterns.txt

Color taxa names and remove boostrap values < 0.5:

	color_tree -t -r 0.5 tree.newick patterns.txt

## Pattern file ##

Tab delimited, two columns -> `pattern`, `color`

pattern: a regular expression pattern

color: one of red, blue, green, yellow, black, or a hexadecimal color
code, e.g., #000000.

If a color other than red, blue, green, yellow, black or a hex color
code is specified, the value will be black.

If a `name_map` is provided, the patterns will search against the new
names (column 2) in the name_map, not the old_names (column 1).

### Example ###

    _Bacteria	blue
    [ds]sDNA virus	#0FF0FF
    e.*coli	red

## Name map ##

Tab delimited, two columns -> `old_name`, `new_name`

Within each category, names must be unique.

If there are unsafe characters in the name, they will be cleaned
using the same rules as for cleaning the newick file.

Unlike the `pattern_file`, `old_name` is treating as a string and not
a regex, i.e., exact string matching is used.

### Example ###

    1a	Silly apple phage
    2a	Mariprofundus seanii

## Dependencies ##

Requires at least Ruby 1.9.

Requires `trollop` and `bio`.

	gem install trollop
	gem install bio

## Notes ##

It might be a good idea to run the `clean_headers` script on your
alignment file before you make your tree.

	clean_headers sequences.fa > seqs.clean.fa

### Importing into FigTree ###

When opening the nexus file in FigTree, make sure to leave the label
name as `label`, so the bootstrap labels will be colored black and not
match the color of the branches.
